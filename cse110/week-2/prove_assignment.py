Your story is:

The other day, I was really in trouble. It all started when I saw a very
{adjective} {animal} {verb} down the hallway coming towards me. "{exclamation.capitalize()}!" I yelled. But all
I could think to do was to {verb} over and over, and it was wack. Miraculously,
that caused it to stop, but not before it tried to {verb}
right in front of my family.
